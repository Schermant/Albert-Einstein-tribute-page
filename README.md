# Albert-Einstein-tribute-page

Hello there!
WARNING: THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!

This is a small project for my self-taught programming program (uh) from freeCodeCamp, feel free to check it!
This features CSS grid positioning, as well as a small snippet for a sticky navbar (inspired from the navbar on Wikipedia).
