# Albert-Einstein-tribute-page

Hello there!

This is a small project for my self-taught programming program (uh) from freeCodeCamp, feel free to check it!

This features CSS grid positioning, as well as a small snippet for a sticky navbar (inspired from the navbar on Wikipedia).

Future planning:
- Completion of the page content, as well as finishing the mark-ups for all DOMs. After this is finished I may submit it to freeCodeCamp. 
> Finished!
- Add explanations and external links for the content where needed.
> Will be put in when I return to this.
- Working on the vision I have for the sticky navbar. 
> Mostly finished, I want to make it more "floaty".
